# Deploying to a server

`server-setup.sh` turns a fresh Debian 13 server into a complete installation: the app in Docker, HTTPS, a mail server that forwards aliases, and basic hardening. It reproduces, step by step, a production setup that was configured and verified by hand.

> **Status:** each step mirrors commands that were run and verified on the production server, but the script as a whole has not been run end to end. Read a step before running it, run steps one at a time if in doubt (`sudo ./deploy/server-setup.sh caddy`), and check the output.

## What you need first

1. A Debian 13 server with a public IPv4 address and open ports 22, 25, 80 and 443. Some providers block port 25; ask them to open it.
2. A domain. The examples use `ershov.me` with the service on `veil.ershov.me`.
3. Your SSH public key in `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` (the script switches SSH to key-only login).

## Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ilia-ershov/iershov_application && cd iershov_application
cp deploy/server.env.example deploy/server.env     # set domain, IP, forwarding address...
sudo ./deploy/server-setup.sh                       # or individual steps: sudo ./deploy/server-setup.sh app caddy
```

At the end the script prints the DNS records to create.

## What happens

| Step | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `packages` | Docker, Caddy, Postfix, postsrsd, OpenDKIM, unbound, fail2ban, unattended-upgrades |
| `app` | `.env` with generated secrets, `docker-compose.override.yml`, `docker compose up` |
| `lookup_role` | Read-only DB role for Postfix (5 columns, no password hashes or 2FA secrets) |
| `site` | Personal page on the root domain (`deploy/site/index.html`) |
| `caddy` | HTTPS for the root domain, `www`, the service and `mail.` (Let's Encrypt, automatic renewal) |
| `postfix` | Receives mail for both domains; active aliases from the DB, personal addresses from `/etc/postfix/virtual`; no open relay; postscreen with Spamhaus/SpamCop; SPF check of incoming mail |
| `srs` | Forwarded mail gets an SRS envelope sender so it passes SPF at the destination |
| `dkim` | 2048-bit keys; signs the server's own mail (codes, notifications) |
| `resolver` | unbound on 127.0.0.1 (Spamhaus refuses queries through public resolvers) |
| `postfix_tls` | Postfix uses Caddy's certificate for `mail.` |
| `fail2ban` | Bans SSH/SMTP brute force (your IPs from `F2B_IGNORE` are never banned) |
| `updates` | Daily automatic security updates, no automatic reboot |
| `ssh` | Key-only SSH (skipped if no key is installed) |
| `backup` | Daily backup at 04:30 of the database, secrets and config, kept for 14 days (`deploy/backup.sh`) |
| `summary` | Prints the DNS records (incl. DKIM) and the PTR request for the provider |

## Outside the server

These can't be scripted:

- **DNS records** at the registrar: A, MX, SPF, DMARC and DKIM, as printed by the `summary` step.
- **PTR (reverse DNS)** of the server IP pointing to `mail.<domain>`. Ask the hosting provider. Without it, Gmail and iCloud reject or spam forwarded mail.

Certificates are issued as soon as the A records resolve. If `postfix_tls` ran too early, re-run `sudo ./deploy/server-setup.sh postfix_tls`.

## Backups

`deploy/backup.sh` (run daily by the `backup` step's systemd timer, or by hand with `sudo ./deploy/backup.sh`) writes `/var/backups/mail-organizer/<date>_<time>/`:

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `db.dump` | The app database (`pg_dump` custom format, checked with `pg_restore --list` right after dumping) |
| `files.tar.gz` | `.env`, `docker-compose.override.yml`, `deploy/server.env`, DKIM keys and tables, `/etc/postsrsd.secret`, Postfix, OpenDKIM and Caddy config |
| `SHA256SUMS` | Checksums of both |

`latest` points to the newest run; runs older than 14 days are deleted. A backup that lives only on the server is lost together with it, so copy it off regularly. It contains secrets, so keep the copy encrypted:

```bash
scp -r root@SERVER:/var/backups/mail-organizer/latest/ ./mail-organizer-backup
```

Check the timer with `systemctl list-timers mail-organizer-backup.timer` and the last run with `journalctl -u mail-organizer-backup`.

## Moving to a new server

Restore the latest backup so that DNS records (DKIM) and accounts stay valid:

```bash
# on the new server, after cloning the repo into the same path
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
# secrets only: the script writes the config itself (the archive's copies are for reference)
tar -xzf files.tar.gz -C / --wildcards '*/.env' 'etc/opendkim/keys' 'etc/postsrsd.secret'
sudo ./deploy/server-setup.sh                       # keeps the existing .env and DKIM keys
docker compose exec -T db pg_restore -U mail_organizer -d mail_organizer --clean --if-exists < db.dump
sudo ./deploy/server-setup.sh lookup_role           # re-grant the Postfix lookup role
```

## Checking the result

```bash
pip install -r live_tests/requirements.txt
BASE_URL=https://veil.example.com MAIL_DOMAIN=veil.example.com SERVER_IP=203.0.113.10 pytest live_tests -v
```

## Files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `server-setup.sh` | The setup script |
| `server.env.example` | Settings template (copy to `server.env`, which is git-ignored) |
| `site/index.html` | Personal page served on the root domain |
| `postfix/lookup-role.sql` | Read-only database role for Postfix |
| `postfix/pgsql-aliases.cf` | Postfix alias lookup query (template) |
| `postfix/main.cf.example` | Minimal Postfix lines for a manual setup |
